Name: Advance Sorting

    You have an integer array of 10000 elements. 
    All elements are already sorted descendingly from 0 to -9999.
    Please sort this array ascendingly using:
    1) selection sort and 
    2) quick sort. 
    Measure the time how long it does take for selection sort and quick sort. 
    
    The sorted output should be -9999, -9998, â€¦0. 
    Time to take quick sorting should be shorter than that of the selection sorting.
